title: Tutorial for using conformal prediction in KNIME
abstract: 'KNIME is an end-to-end software platform for data science with an open
  source analytics platform for creating solutions and a commercial server solution
  for productionization. Redfield have previously developed nodes for conformal classification
  in KNIME. We introduce an extended conformal prediction package with added support
  for conformal regression.  The conformal prediction package include class-conditional
  conformal classification, conformal regression and normalized conformal regression.
  The updated package also includes several new and updated nodes that focus on ease-of-use.
  This paper provide an introduction to various use cases for both simplified and
  advanced use as well as experiments to prove validity and showcase functionality.
  All examples are publicly available and the package is available through KNIME’s
  official software channels.  '
