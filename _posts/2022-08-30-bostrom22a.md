title: 'crepes: a Python Package for Generating Conformal Regressors and Predictive
  Systems'
abstract: The recently released Python package crepes can be used to generate both
  conformal regressors, which transform point predictions into prediction intervals
  for specified levels of confidence, and conformal predictive systems, which transform
  the point predictions into cumulative distribution functions (conformal predictive
  distributions). The \texttt{crepes} package implements standard, normalized and
  Mondrian conformal regressors and predictive systems, and is completely model-agnostic,
  using only the residuals for the calibration instances, possibly together with difficulty
  estimates and Mondrian categories as input, when forming the conformal regressors
  and predictive systems. This allows the user to easily incorporate and evaluate
  novel difficulty estimates and ways of forming Mondrian categories, as well as combinations
  thereof. Examples from using the package are given, illustrating how to incorporate
  some standard options for difficulty estimation, forming Mondrian categories and
  the use of out-of-bag predictions for calibration, through helper functions defined
  in a separate module, called \texttt{crepes.fillings}. The relation to other software
  packages for conformal regression is also pointed out.
