title: Pruning neural networks for inductive conformal prediction
abstract: 'Neural network pruning techniques are used to prune redundant parameters
  in overparameterized neural networks in order to compress the model size and reduce
  computational cost. The goal is to prune a neural network in such a way that it
  has the same, or nearly the same, predictive performance as the original. In this
  paper we study neural network pruning in the context of conformal prediction. In
  order to explore whether the neural network can be pruned while maintaining the
  predictive efficiency of conformal predictors, our work measures and compares the
  efficiency of the prediction sets provided by the inductive conformal predictor
  built with an underlying pruned neural network. We implement several existing pruning
  methods and propose a new pruning method based specifically on the conformal prediction
  framework. By evaluating with various neural network architectures and across several
  data sets, we find that the pruned network can maintain, or indeed improve, the
  efficiency of the conformal predictors up to a particular pruning ratio and this
  pruning ratio varies with different architectures and data sets. These results are
  instructive for deploying pruned neural network in real-work applications within
  the context of conformal predictors, where reliable predictions and reduced computational
  cost are relevant, e.g. in healthcare or safety-critical applications. This work
  is also relevant for further work applying continual learning techniques in the
  context of conformal predictors. '
