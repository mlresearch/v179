title: Conformal prediction of small-molecule drug resistance in cancer cell lines
abstract: 'Drug design is a critical step in the drug discovery process, where promising
  drug molecules are engineered to be later evaluated preclinically and perhaps clinically.
  Phenotypic drug design has again gained traction. Cancer cell lines, a frequently
  adopted {\it in vitro} model for phenotype drug design, can be used to evaluate
  the drug resistance level (lack of inhibitory activity, for example) of a large
  number of molecules, and discard those that are the least likely to become drug
  candidates. By reusing these datasets, supervised learning models have been built
  to predict drug resistance on cancer cell lines. Usually, these methods have assigned
  reliability to the whole model rather than reliability to individual predictions
  (molecules). In problems such as drug design, accurately achieving the latter would
  revolutionize decision making. Conformal prediction is a model-agnostic method to
  assign reliability to each model prediction. In this study, we investigated the
  impact of conformal prediction on the prediction of inhibitory activity of molecules
  on a given cancer cell line. This analysis was carried out in each of the 60 cell
  lines from the NCI-60 panel to understand the variability of the results across
  cancer types. We also discussed the implications of predicting the molecules considered
  most potent. In addition, we investigated how the further subdivision of the training
  set to build conformal prediction models may affect the results obtained. Overall,
  we observed that those molecules deemed most reliable by conformal prediction are
  substantially better predicted than those that are not. This suggest that such computational
  tools are promising to guide phenotypic drug design. '
