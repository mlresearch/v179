title: 'Uncertain data in learning: challenges and opportunities'
abstract: 'Dealing with uncertain data in statistical estimation problems or in machine
  learning is not really a new issue. However, such uncertainty has so far mostly
  been modelled either as sets, being called for instance coarse data or partial labels,
  or as probability distributions over data values, being called for instance soft
  labels. Integrating this uncertainty in the learning process can be challenging,
  but also rewarding, as it can improve both the quality of the made predictions as
  well as our understanding of the obtained model. Within this setting, rich uncertainty
  models generalizing both probabilities and sets offer both new challenges and opportunities,
  and I will summarise some of them in this short note.  '
