title: Conformal Decision Rules
abstract: This paper proposes conformal decision rules. They are defined as decision
  rules with their own conformal predictors. Given a test instance, conformal decision
  rules provide a point prediction, an explanation, a p-value for that prediction
  plus a prediction set.
