title: A Betting Function for addressing Concept Drift with Conformal Martingales
abstract: 'An important issue that appears when using Conformal Martingales (CM) for
  detecting Concept Drift (CD), is that martingale values get very close to zero when
  the data generating mechanism remains the same for a large number of instances.
  In such cases, the martingale takes a long time to recover, resulting in detection
  delays or even totally failing to detect the occurrence of a CD. To address this
  issue we propose a new betting function we call Cautious, that avoids betting when
  there is no evidence that any change is taking place, therefore preventing the continuous
  reduction of the martingale value. The proposed betting function can be built on
  top of any existing betting function to mitigate the aforementioned problem. In
  this work, we combine it with the kernel and histogram betting functions and compare
  its performance with that of the two original betting functions as well as that
  of existing methods for addressing CD on five datasets.  '
