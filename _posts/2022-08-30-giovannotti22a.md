title: " Calibration of Natural Language Understanding Models with Venn–ABERS Predictors"
abstract: 'Transformers, currently the state-of-the-art in natural language understanding
  (NLU) tasks, are prone to generate uncalibrated predictions or extreme probabilities,
  making the process of taking different decisions based on their output relatively
  difficult. In this paper we propose to build several inductive Venn–ABERS predictors
  (IVAP), which are guaranteed to be well calibrated under minimal assumptions, based
  on a selection of pre-trained transformers. We test their performance over a set
  of diverse NLU tasks and show that they are capable of producing well-calibrated
  probabilistic predictions that are uniformly spread over the [0,1] interval – all
  while retaining the original model�s predictive accuracy.  '
