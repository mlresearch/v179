title: Well-Calibrated Rule Extractors
abstract: " While explainability is widely considered necessary for trustworthy predictive
  models, most explanation modules give only a limited understanding of the reasoning
  behind the predictions. In pedagogical rule extraction, an opaque model is approximated
  with a transparent model induced using original training instances, but with the
  predictions from the opaque model as targets. The result is an interpretable model
  revealing the exact reasoning used for every possible prediction. The pedagogical
  approach can be applied to any opaque model and use any learning algorithm producing
  transparent models as the actual rule extractor. Unfortunately, even if the extracted
  model is induced to mimic the opaque, test set fidelity may still be poor, thus
  clearly limiting the value of using the extracted model for explanations and analyses.
  In this paper, it is suggested to alleviate this problem by extracting probabilistic
  predictors with well-calibrated fitness estimates. For the calibration, Venn-Abers
  with its unique validity guarantees, is employed. Using a setup where decision trees
  are extracted from MLP neural networks, the suggested approach is first demonstrated
  in detail on one real-world data set. After that, a large-scale empirical evaluation
  using 25 publicly available benchmark data sets is presented. The results show that
  the method indeed extracts interpretable models with well-calibrated fitness estimates,
  i.e., the extracted model can be used for explaining the opaque. Specifically, in
  the setup used, every leaf in a decision tree contains a label and a well-calibrated
  probability interval for the fidelity. Consequently, a user could, in addition to
  obtaining explanations of individual predictions, find the parts of feature space
  where the decision tree is a good approximation of the MLP and not. In fact, using
  the sizes of the probability intervals, the models also provide an indication of
  how certain individual fitness estimates are.  "
