title: Uncertainty Estimation for Single-cell Label Transfer
abstract: 'Single-cell gene expression matrices require a cell type label for each
  cell for downstream analysis. A cell type label refers to a heterogeneous group
  to which a cell belongs. Machine learning algorithms that aim to automate the assignment
  of cell type labels train on reference datasets for which cell type labels are already
  defined. However, these methods are prone to error due to possible preprocessing
  errors and the dynamic nature of cellular states. Therefore, it is essential to
  measure the uncertainty associated with classifications.  Here, we hypothesize that
  conformal prediction may provide a principled approach for this. We examine inductive
  conformal classifiers (ICPs) on the task of single-cell label transfer. ICPs lead
  to well-calibrated models that quantify uncertainties well. Results are motivating,
  and the uncertainties are intuitive and easy to interpret. We also consider a confidence-credibility
  conformal predictions setup that accurately predicts single labels with the desired
  error level. Such a model can also reject the classification of cell types unobserved
  in the reference dataset. However, the presence of unknown cell types violates the
  underlying assumption of a conformal predictor and is highly dependent on the quality
  of batch correction. We envision more work in detecting unknown cell types and using
  conformal predictions to evaluate batch correction methods. '
