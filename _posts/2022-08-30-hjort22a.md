title: 'House Price Prediction with Confidence: Empirical Results from the Norwegian
  Market'
abstract: " Automated Valuation Models are statistical models used by banks and other
  financial institutions to estimate the price of a dwelling, typically motivated
  by financial risk management purposes. The preferred choice of model for this task
  is often tree based machine learning models such as gradient boosted trees or random
  forest, where uncertainty quantification is a major challenge. In this empirical
  contribution, we compare split conformal inference, conformalized quantile regression
  and Mondrian conformalized quantile regression on data from the Norwegian housing
  market, and use random forest as a point prediction. The data consists of $N$ =
  29 993 transactions from Oslo (Norway) from the time period 2018-2019. The results
  indicate that the methods using conformalized quantile regression create narrower
  confidence regions than split conformal inference."
