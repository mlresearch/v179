title: Online Portfolio Hedging with the Weak Aggregating Algorithm
abstract: 'In this paper we apply the Weak Aggregating Algorithm to find optimal risk
  management strategies for financial Market Makers (MMs). Here risk is caused by
  the market exposure. It is effectively represented by the MM’s overall net {\it
  position}, which is the aggregation of all the {\it buy} and {\it sell} trades carried
  out by the MM�s clients at a given point in time. So-called {\it hedging} strategies
  are used by MMs to manage their risk and reduce market exposure. In essence, the
  MM actively places trades in order to reduce its overall net position, keeping it
  within some predefined bounds and as neutral (or flat) as possible. A flatter net
  position allows the MM to counter any unfavourable price movements which could otherwise
  incur a significant loss. We apply the Weak Aggregating Algorithm (WAA) to hedging
  strategies, which are treated as the experts. We combine their hedging decisions
  with the goal of reducing portfolio risk and maximising profitability, whilst also
  attempting to smooth out significant drawdowns. We develop a variation of the WAA
  using discounting and evaluate the WAA on a subset of real life client risk data
  in three commonly traded Foreign Exchange (FX) currency symbols: EUR/USD, EUR/GBP
  and GBP/USD. The results show how varying loss parameters and application of discount
  factors can enable the WAA to give combinations of hedging strategies that can significantly
  improve profitability and reduce drawdowns as compared to the benchmark of not hedging.'
