title: Conformal prediction for hypersonic flight vehicle classification
abstract: 'This paper introduces a probabilistic guaranteed prediction method for
  trajectory data of the hypersonic flight vehicle classification problem. This paper
  devoted two problems: (1) hypersonic flight vehicle trajectory classification algorithm
  using functional data analysis method, and (2) a distributions-free uncertainty
  quantity for the classification results applying conformal prediction methodology.
  Our approach provides explicit finite-sample guarantees for any data set by using
  functional data analysis methods, which map the original data into feature space.
  The distribution-free uncertainty quantity results for the label of new objects
  include two indications, such as confidence and credibility respectively. Lastly,
  the proposed method aims to communicate instance-wise uncertainty under the probabilistic
  guaranteed and generate a prediction set at a user-specified confidence level for
  the hypersonic flight vehicle classification problem. '
