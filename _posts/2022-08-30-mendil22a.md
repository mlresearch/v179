title: Robust Gas Demand Forecasting With Conformal Prediction
abstract: " Predicting the future trends of customer gas demand as precisely as possible
  is vital for securing the supply chain from production to distribution. The operations
  at Air Liquide require the predictions of a Machine Learning forecaster to be coupled
  with rigorous Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), building trustworthy and informative
  prediction intervals. To address these industrial needs, we propose to apply Conformal
  Prediction (CP), a framework that can provide probabilistic guarantees for any underlying
  predictive model. The problem is formulated as time series forecasting, which may
  counter the CP hypothesis of data exchangeability. Nevertheless, our experiments
  show that CP methods enhance the predictive coverage of the tested UQ approaches.
  We also test EnbPI, a conformal method designed specifically for time series, and
  propose a locally adaptive variant. To carry out our experiments with prediction
  intervals using multiple regression models, we introduce our new python library
  PUNCC and a novel dataset (around 10k observations) provided by Air Liquide which
  leverages over 7 years of data of weekly gas consumption."
