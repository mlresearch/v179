title: Cough-based COVID-19 detection with audio quality clustering and confidence
  measure based learning
abstract: " COVID-19 cough classification has rapidly become a promising research
  avenue as an accessible and low-cost screening alternative, needing only a smartphone
  to collect and process cough samples. However, audio processing of recordings collected
  in uncontrolled environments and prediction confidence are key challenges that need
  to be addressed before cough-screening could be widely accepted as a trusted testing
  method. Therefore, we propose a novel approach for cough event detection that identifies
  {\\it cough clusters} instead of individual coughs, significantly reducing onset
  detectionâ€™s usual hypersensitivity to energy fluctuations between cough phases.
  By using this technique to improve training sample quality and quantity by +200%,
  we improve Machine Learning performance on the minority COVID-19 class by up to
  20%, achieving up to +47% precision and +15% recall compared to the dataset baseline.
  We propose a novel, class-agnostic Conformal Prediction non-conformity measure which
  takes the cough sample quality into account to counteract the variance caused by
  limiting segmentation to just the training set. Our Conformal Prediction model introduces
  uncertainty quantification to COVID-19 cough classification and achieves an additional
  34% improvement to precision and recall."
