title: On efficiency of Learning Under Privileged Information
abstract: The paradigm of Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI) was used in
  various practical applications, including its combination with Conformal Prediction
  (CP) framework. In this note, we discuss possible sources and limitations of its
  efficiency. We try to argue that accuracy improvement coming from using privileged
  information is not occasional. For this goal, we consider some minimalistic models
  of LUPI where the contribution of the privileged information appears in its noise-free
  essence. Then, we discuss connection of LUPI paradigm and CP framework in relation
  with the models.
