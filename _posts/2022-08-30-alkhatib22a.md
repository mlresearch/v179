title: Assessing Explanation Quality by Venn Prediction
abstract: " Rules output by explainable machine learning techniques naturally come
  with a degree of uncertainty, as the complex functionality of the underlying black-box
  model often can be difficult to approximate by a single, interpretable rule. However,
  the uncertainty of these approximations is not properly quantified by current explanatory
  techniques. The use of Venn prediction is here proposed and investigated as a means
  to quantify the uncertainty of the explanations and thereby also allow for competing
  explanation techniques to be evaluated with respect to their relative uncertainty.
  A number of metrics of rule explanation quality based on uncertainty are proposed
  and discussed, including metrics that capture the tendency of the explanations to
  predict the correct outcome of a black-box model on new instances, how informative
  (tight) the produced intervals are, and how certain a rule is when predicting one
  class. An empirical investigation is presented, in which explanations produced by
  the state-of-the-art technique Anchors are compared to explanatory rules obtained
  from association rule mining. The results suggest that the association rule mining
  approach may provide explanations with less uncertainty towards the correct label,
  as predicted by the black-box model, compared to Anchors. The results also show
  that the explanatory rules obtained through association rule mining result in tighter
  intervals and are closer to either one or zero compared to Anchors, i.e., they are
  more certain towards a specific class label.  "
