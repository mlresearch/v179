title: Ellipsoidal conformal inference for Multi-Target Regression
abstract: 'Quantifying the uncertainty of a predictive model output is of essential
  importance in learning scenarios involving critical applications. As the learning
  task becomes more complex, so does uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we
  consider the task of multi-target regression and propose a method to output ellipsoidal
  confidence regions whose shapes are tailored to each instance to predict. We also
  guarantee that those confidence regions are well-calibrated, i.e., that they cover
  the ground truth with a specified probability. To achieve such a feat, we propose
  a conformal prediction method outputting ellipsoidal prediction regions. Experiments
  on both simulated and real-world data sets show that our methods outperform existing
  ones.  '
