title: 'Conformal testing: binary case with Markov alternatives'
abstract: 'We continue study of conformal testing in binary model situations. In this
  paper we consider Markov alternatives to the null hypothesis of exchangeability.
  We propose two new classes of conformal test martingales; one class is statistically
  efficient in our experiments, and the other class partially sacrifices statistical
  efficiency to gain simplicity and computational efficiency.  '
